133. Clone Graph https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/description/

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.
Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
Test case format:
For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.
An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.
Example 1:
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
Example 2:
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
Example 3:
Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 100
Node.val is unique for each node.
There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

SOLUTION
Cloning a graph involves creating new nodes that mirror the values and connections of the original graph,
such that changing the clone wonâ€™t affect the original.
The main challenges:
Nodes may be referenced multiple times (by neighbors).
To avoid creating duplicate nodes, we need a way to keep track of which nodes have already been cloned.
The graph may contain cycles.
This is commonly solved using DFS (Depth-First Search) or BFS (Breadth-First Search), tracking clones with a hashmap.
Clone Mapping
Use a dictionary (cloned) to map each original node to its cloned node, preventing duplicates and handling cycles.
Depth-First Search (DFS)
Start from the given node.
If the current node has already been cloned, return it.
Otherwise, create a new clone, store it in the dictionary, and recursively clone all its neighbors.
Neighbor Handling
Recursively add each neighbor's clone to the current node's neighbor list.
