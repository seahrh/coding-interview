56. Merge Intervals https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/description/

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals,
and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.
Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
Constraints:
1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
intervals[i].length == 2
0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^4

SOLUTION
We are merging overlapping intervals â€” whenever two intervals overlap,
we merge them into a single one that covers both ranges.
If we sort by start time, any overlapping intervals must be adjacent.
Time O(N lg N)
Space O(1), if the result list is ignored.
