"""
Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

Examples:

s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode",
return 2.
Note: You may assume the string contain only lowercase letters.

SOLUTION
We scan the string from left to right counting the number occurrences of each character in a hashtable.
Then we perform a second pass and check the counts of every character.
Whenever we hit a count of 1 we return that character, thatâ€™s the first unique letter.
