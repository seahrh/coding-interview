"""
572. Subtree of Another Tree https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/description/

Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot,
return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.
A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants.
The tree tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.
Example 1:
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: false
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the root tree is in the range [1, 2000].
The number of nodes in the subRoot tree is in the range [1, 1000].
-10^4 <= root.val <= 10^4
-10^4 <= subRoot.val <= 10^4

SOLUTION
Time O(MN)
Space O(1)
